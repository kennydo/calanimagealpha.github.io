                <h2>About CAA</h2>
                Cal Animage Alpha has been UC Berkeley's anime club since 1989. We hold anime showings every Monday and a game night every Thursday. We also have other events. All of these functions are open to the general public for free!
                </p>

                <div class="history">

                  <h3>A History of CAA by Rodney Romasata</h3>

                  <input class="spoilerbutton" type="button" value="Show" onclick="this.value=this.value=='Show'?'Hide':'Show';">
                  <div class="spoiler"><div>
                    <p class="sub">Cal Animage Alpha ("CAA") is the flagship chapter of a loosely organized international conglomeration of anime clubs all of which share the name "Cal Animage" (often, but not always, followed by the Greek letter denoting their entrance and acceptance into the group). Originally just a group of friends (with a VCR) CAA met in any number of various rooms on the University of California, Berkeley campus; Cal Animage was formally established by Mike Tatsugawa in January 1989. </p>

                    <p>While the debate is still on as to "who is the oldest anime club," CAA has the distinction and claim to fame of once being "the largest anime club outside of Japan." In 1994 (the peak of the club's popularity), the club's membership topped out at 329 (although there is some confusion as to the exact number since some didn't pay for membership that year!).</p>

                    <p>Many past officers both from CAA and other Cal Animage chapters have gone on to further spread anime. The Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation (SPJA) [was] headed by Mike Tatsugawa and runs the annual Anime Expo. Other previous officers have moved on into the anime industry, both domestic and abroad. One in particular has worked on both sides of the Pacific Ocean and has written the liner notes for the AnimEigo release of the Macross DVD.</p>

                    <p>With the release of domestic anime, CAA has slowed down quite a bit. Membership has been fairly constant around 100. The main focus of the weekly Monday showings has been towards those titles that would have little chance of being released in America, yet popular enough to hold an audience's attention. A rather tall order, but the club is persisting.</p>

                    <p>Come to one of our Monday evening showings between 7:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. and maybe you'll see why the club is still able to hold its own.</p>
